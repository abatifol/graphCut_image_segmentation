# graphCut_image_segmentation


# 📌 Description
This is an repository that try to reproduce the Paper: "". 

We used it for a class project, we added the report [here](https://github.com/gardiens/Noise2NoiseMapping_pytorch/blob/main/Report-Noise2Mapping.pdf) 

Also, if you ❤️ or simply use this project, don't forget to give the repository a ⭐, it means a lot to us !
